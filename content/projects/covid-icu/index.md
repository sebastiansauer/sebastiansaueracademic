Analysis related to Covid 19 severity in patients at an ICU

This repo describes the analyses of correlates of Covid 19 severity in patients at a large intensiv cure unit (ICU) in a German hospital in 2022.

More specifically, the main research question is which predictors allow to classify the severity of a Covid 19 infection in the inpatients (ie., observations of the present sample).

The analyses was performed in R, primarily relying on tidyverse and tidymodels. Check out the Rmd files for a reproducible account of your analyses. The analyses source file are numbered as to their order in the main analyses (ie., start file 01, then comes 02, ...).
