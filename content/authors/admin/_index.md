Sebastian Sauer is a professor with a focus on cognitive psychology and data science at the University of Applied Sciences Ansbach. 
His research interests include applying machine learning to social science questions, didactics of statistics, mindfulness, and social media analysis.
He thinks that science is obligated to truth and the social good.
