[stats-nutshell](https://stats-nutshell.netlify.app/)

Analyzing research data can broadly be classified in three parts: explorative data analysis, modeling (including inference), and visualization. Either part is pivotal in its own right, but it can be argued that modeling is at the core of the scientific endeavor. However, in practice, modeling, visualization, and data exploration is heavily intertwined, so that three parts may be recognized (as individual entities) but not usefully separated from each other. This idea provides the rationale of this course: Data exploration, data visualization and data modeling is discussed as an integrated framework.

The focus is on practical data analysis; theoretical concepts are, where mentioned, second class citizens due to time constraints and the didactic aims of the course.
